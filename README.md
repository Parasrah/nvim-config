# Neovim Configuration

Hi, this is my configuration for neovim, a popular text editor seeking feature parity with vim while adopting a different approach to development. You can read more about it [here](https://neovim.io) if you're interested.

# Languages

I program in a variety of languages, and have tried to build a config that works for all of them while also maintaining stability:

* Elm
* Elixir
* Javascript
* Typescript
* C#
* Lua
* Rust
* Golang

# Lua

I am (at the time of writing) in the middle of moving parts of my configuration over to lua (from vimscript). You're welcome to look at this as an example of how it can be done, but I'm definitely not an expert and I'm sure this will be in constant flux as I learn more about lua and the Neovim API
