# Neovim Configuration

Hi, this is my configuration for Neovim, a popular text editor seeking feature parity with vim while adopting a different approach to development. You can read more about it [here](https://neovim.io) if you're interested.

# Languages

I program in a variety of languages, and have tried to build a config that works for all of them while prioritising:

- reliability
- speed
- playing well with vim features

That said I am a strong proponent of Language Server Protocol (and linting).

I currently use the following languages regularly:

* Elixir
* Elm
* Nix
* Lua
* Javascript
* Typescript
* C#
* Rust

# Roadmap

- [ ] leverage tags in config
- [ ] custom statusline using lua
- [ ] move over to builtin nvim language client

# Stretch Goals

- [ ] move config to lua (after 5.0)
- [ ] remove omnisharp
- [ ] use tree-sitter for syntax highlighting (after 5.0)
- [ ] lockfile for plugins
