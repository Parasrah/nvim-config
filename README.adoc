= Neovim Configuration

Hi, this is my configuration for Neovim, a popular text editor seeking feature
parity with vim while adopting a different approach to development. You can
read more about it https://neovim.io[here] if you're interested.

== Update - June 16, 2020

I am no longer actively using neovim, despite how great it and the *neovim*
community are, as I now use an alternative modal editor, Kakoune.

== Languages

I program in a variety of languages, and have tried to build a config that
works for all of them while prioritising:

* reliability
* speed
* playing well with vim features

That said I am a strong proponent of Language Server Protocol (and linting).

I currently use the following languages regularly:

* Elixir
* Elm
* Nix
* Lua
* Javascript
* Typescript
* C#
* Rust
